        <p>Hi, we are TrendFeed. We produce news that really interests you. In a an age were everybody is connected by social
          media the whole world enters your mind by glimpses of the truth. Maybe Fake news is a larger concept than we think,
          in how far is the media truth to reality? and in how far do they just want to be the most popular? TrendFeed is
          a project that took this fact as inspiration. We generate Fake News by mixing real headliner news and the most
          trending terms on the internet. By tricking you we hope to provoke a critic attitude against the media these days.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Time is going fast and everything has to go fast today this has the consequence that we don’t take the time to watch
          the news, read the paper, watch documentaries. Media responds to this by shortening their articles and making their
          headlines more attractive. But isn’t this a form of censorship? by leaving more and more small details, the context
          of a story, person, happening,… will get lost and the story gets more blurry.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>The core of taking decisions in which is worth to publish or not has shifted from what is really important news to
          what interestes us. We are more interested in the social life of a famous person than real world news. We are presented
          with an illusion of choice but in reality just a few companies controls the media stream. And we eat it!</p>
